Calories App

Description

This is a quick todo example app built with NodeJS and Angular stack

How to run the app

A few notes before the bullet list. The app uses gulp as the build system, mongo for the DB, NodeJS for the
backend and Angular for the frontend

So now, lets go to the Installation:

1. Clone the project
2. Install mongodb if you dont already have it (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
3. Start mongodb (mongod)
4. Go to the restApi directory
5. Install dependencies (npm install)
6. Install gulp (npm install -g gulp)
7 run the restApi (gulp)
8. Go to the client directory
9 Install dependencies (npm install&bower install)
10. Run the client
